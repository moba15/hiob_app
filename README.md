### Templates

- **Important:** The new features are all highly experimental
- I completly rewrote the way templates/widgtes work
- You now can find two (new) widgets one of them a new input widget
- With the new types of widgtes you can directly add a popupmenu, so you don't have to use a advanced widget for this
